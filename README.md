A Pokemon wikipage replica made in HTML and CSS containing all the necessary information about Pok√©mon's.The information has been structured and designed in the form of tables, flexes, grids, etc.  It has been enhanced and beautifies with amazing CSS , images and logos. The webpage doesn't actually perform any action but it is sample of how a creative wiki page would look like. I have tried to use every possible attribute found in HtML, one can find tables,flexes,cards,lists,navbars,links,buttons,input fields,header,footer,images,multiples divs and sections, etc.
